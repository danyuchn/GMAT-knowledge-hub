# The Biggest Misconception in Using AI for Exam Preparation

Using AI for exam preparation, the greatest error is assuming that AI “truly understands the GMAT.” In reality, AI does not know what the GMAT is. If you want AI to genuinely assist you in your studies, you must first clarify:

1. **What do you need it to help you with?**  
2. **What workflow can it assist you with?**  
3. **What background knowledge is required in its workflow?**  
4. **How do you impart this background knowledge to it?**

## Treating AI as a Colleague, Not a Servant

Isn’t this similar to mentoring a junior colleague in your company to become a collaborative partner?

## A Demonstration: AI Assisting with RC Passage Creation

Here is an example:

1. **What I need AI to do for me:** Generate RC passages in the GMAT style for my reading practice.

If at this point you simply ask AI to “generate passages in the GMAT style,” that is the end of the discussion—because it does not actually know what the GMAT is. So let us move to step two:

## The Workflow for Creating GMAT Passages

2. **What is the workflow required for a test creator to produce GMAT passages?**

- Select source texts (articles/essays) → Apply specific rewriting strategies → Produce the passage

## Background Knowledge Required: Source Selection and Rewriting Strategies

3. **In this process, what background knowledge is necessary:**

- **Which source texts does the GMAT choose?**  
  On the GMAT Club forum, many official questions have been linked by enthusiastic community members who uncovered the original source texts. We learn that most of these sources are from publications such as *Scientific American* or various academic journals.

- **What are the specific rewriting strategies?**  
  I compared several original texts with their AI-rewritten GMAT versions and categorized them into three levels: vocabulary, sentence structure, and logical organization. From this, I summarized the rewriting strategies used for the GMAT. For each category, I asked for examples to verify accuracy.

## Imparting the Background Knowledge to AI

4. **How do you transfer this background knowledge to AI?**

Once I have confirmed that these rewriting strategies exist and are correct, I instruct the AI to conceptualize, standardize, and transform them into an accurate prompt.

## Example Instruction: Rewriting an Academic Passage into a GMAT Style Article

Thus, the following directive is established:

```
You are a professional science communicator and writing simplification expert.
Your task is to rewrite the following academic passage into a 250–400 word article suitable for educated non-specialist readers (e.g., science-interested high school or university students). The rewrite should apply the following 3 levels of simplification strategies:
	1. Lexical (word-level) simplification:
	    - Replace academic or technical terms with common equivalents where possible.
	    - Remove or generalize overly specific numerical or temporal references.
	    - Avoid jargon unless essential and explained.
	2. Syntactic (sentence-level) simplification:
	    - Break down long or embedded sentences into multiple short, clear statements.
	    - Convert passive voice to active voice where it improves clarity.
	    - Remove modifiers and subordinate clauses that are not central to the main point.
	3. Structural (discourse-level) simplification:
	    - Restructure the paragraph flow into a clear, linear narrative.
	    - Merge or compress paragraphs with similar topics.
	    - Remove complex theoretical framing or scholarly conclusion sections unless they can be rewritten plainly.
Ensure that:
	•	The key hypothesis, findings, and implications of the original text are retained.
	•	The rewritten version is logically coherent, informative, and engaging.
	•	The total length remains between 250 and 400 words.
	•	Do not include direct quotations or citations from the original.
	•	Use clear transitions and accessible language suitable for general public science communication.
Now rewrite the following passage: [Input]
```

You can input online research papers, and it will help you transform them into GMAT-style passages.

## Future Plans: Blind Testing to Validate Quality

In the future, I will have the AI assist in designing blind tests with statistical rigor—mixing AI-generated passages with authentic GMAT passages—to determine whether students can distinguish between AI-produced and genuine GMAT content, thereby ensuring that the passages generated by my prompt are valuable for exam preparation.

## In Conclusion: Four Essential Questions

**Conclusion:**

1. What do you need it to help you with?  
2. What workflow can it assist you with?  
3. What background knowledge is required in its workflow?  
4. How do you impart this background knowledge to it?

## Viewing AI as a Partner

Treat AI as your partner rather than mindlessly ordering it to be your servant. Your strong self-regulation, high standards for accuracy and organization, ability to deconstruct and abstract language structures, and the concept of “separation of duties” will enable you to achieve the most effective collaboration with AI.
