### **Sentence Cracker: An AI Tool to Boost GMAT Reading by 80 Points**

#### **Overview**
I’ve been a GMAT instructor for over 10 years, specializing in Verbal Reasoning and tackling the reading comprehension challenges faced by Taiwanese students. A persistent problem emerged: students struggle with academic-style sentences—not just due to vocabulary, but also complex syntax. Pre-AI solutions were manual and inefficient. **Sentence Cracker** is my response—a generative AI-powered tool designed to provide personalized reading support. This doc outlines its purpose, mechanics, and impact.

#### **Problem Statement**
Asian students’ reading difficulties stem from three key issues:  
- **General Vocabulary**: Non-discipline-specific terms (e.g., “probably,” “therefore,” “however”). Example: A student didn’t recognize “nevertheless” as “however.”  
- **Specialized Terms**: Context-dependent words (e.g., “photosynthesis,” “inflation”). Memorizing definitions without understanding the background is insufficient.  
- **Sentence Structure**: Complex constructions—long modifiers, parallel clauses, distant subject-verb pairs, inversions.  

Students report “I don’t understand this” (symptom); the root causes (vocab, context, grammar) require diagnosis. As an instructor, I leverage experience to identify and address these.

#### **Pre-AI Approach**
Before AI, my methods were labor-intensive:  
- **General Vocab**: Assigned dictionary lookups and synonym transcription.  
- **Specialized Terms**: Provided ad-hoc context (e.g., photosynthesis: CO2 → O2 conversion).  
- **Structure**: Manually deconstructed sentences (e.g., “The scientist, renowned for his discoveries, published a paper” → “The scientist published a paper. He is renowned for his discoveries”) and sourced practice examples.  

These were effective in one-on-one settings but unscalable. Tools like *Yang Peng’s Tough Sentences*—a popular GMAT resource—offered standardized examples, missing the mark since each student’s “tough” varies (e.g., parallel clauses vs. modifiers).

#### **Solution: Sentence Cracker**
Built with generative AI, **Sentence Cracker** focuses on customization:  
1. **Input**: User submits a GMAT sentence they can’t parse.  
2. **Simplification**: AI rephrases into shorter sentences for initial comprehension.  
3. **Self-Diagnosis**: User compares original vs. simplified version to identify vocab or structure gaps.  
4. **Tailored Support**:  
   - **General Vocab**: Returns definition, synonyms (e.g., “however” → “nevertheless”), and antonyms (e.g., “however” → “similarly”). Example: “consequently” → “therefore,” “as a result.”  
   - **Specialized Terms**: Provides definition + context (e.g., “inflation” → price increase mechanics + “deflation,” “GDP”). Example: “ecosystem” → food chain explanation, linked to “biodiversity.”  
   - **Structure**: Breaks down grammar (subject, verb, modifier) + generates parallel examples (e.g., “The book, written by a famous author, is on the table” → “The car, repaired by a skilled mechanic, is in the garage”).  

#### **Results**
Case study: A student with 80 wpm reading speed struggled in Verbal, guessing the last 5-6 questions under time pressure (e.g., economics passage with “inflation,” “recession” → complete abandonment). After weeks with Sentence Cracker, speed rose to 150-180 wpm, enabling full question comprehension and a stable mindset. Score improved from 565 to 645 (+80 points). Key takeaway: Mastery over the test, not just a score bump.

#### **Future Enhancements**
Planned features:  
- **Self-Assessment**: User inputs sentence interpretation; AI compares to actual meaning, flagging vocab vs. structure errors.  
- **Vocab Expansion**: Analyzes difficulty via a preset word bank, suggests level-appropriate additions beyond synonyms.  
- **Term Drills**: Generates field-specific reading passages (e.g., economics text for “inflation” struggles).  
- **Hybrid Practice**: Combines weak vocab with tough structures (e.g., “She studied hard; however, he relaxed all day” for parallel clause issues).  
- **Analytics**: Logs data to a backend, enabling AI-driven reading diagnostics for instructors.  

#### **Impact**
Historically, this level of personalization was limited to one-on-one tutoring—scaling was impractical due to time constraints. Education remained labor-intensive. With generative AI, Sentence Cracker ensures students target their specific weaknesses, bypassing irrelevant material. It benefits students and empowers instructors with data-driven insights. I’m evolving from a GMAT teacher to an EdTech architect.
