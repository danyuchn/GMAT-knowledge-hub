# How Terminator Helps Students Review Effectively

## What Is the Traditional Review Method?
The traditional way of reviewing involves students silently solving questions—sometimes doing a large number of them. After completing the questions, they immediately check the answers. If they got the answer right, they move on without further thought. If they got it wrong, they glance at the explanation and then forget about the question.

The problems with this approach are:
1. **No real learning occurs, leading to repeated mistakes on similar concepts in the future.**
2. **Exhausting all available questions without actually improving, leaving no new material for practice later.**

The only thing you gain from this method is a dopamine release from your brain’s reward system—similar to the effect of scrolling through Instagram stories, Reels, or TikTok.

## Terminator’s Review Method
At Terminator, we use a **completely new review approach**. For subjects where students struggle, I ask them to:
1. **Record their thought process while solving questions.** The goal is to capture every step and reasoning behind their approach. They can also type, but recording is faster.
2. **Compare their recorded thoughts with my detailed solution videos** to identify any misalignment between their thinking and the concepts taught in class.

Compared to traditional methods, this approach ensures that students **truly identify their gaps in understanding instead of pretending they understand.**

## A Learning Method Analogy
I often compare this method to joining a **professional sports team**—where you first study the **correct pitching form**, then record yourself and compare your movements to a professional’s in slow motion. This kind of progress is solid and structured.

Recently, I came across the **Feynman Learning Technique**, and I realized that it aligns perfectly with the recording-based review method I advocate. The Feynman technique emphasizes **explaining concepts in simple terms to someone with no prior knowledge**. By doing so, you can determine whether you truly understand the material. If you don’t, explaining it clearly becomes nearly impossible.

## Applying the Feynman Learning Technique
When students listen to their own recorded explanations, they often notice:
1. **Hesitations in their explanation.**
2. **Vague, illogical, or missing connections in their reasoning.**

These gaps highlight the exact areas they need to revisit when comparing their approach to expert solutions. This process of **identifying misunderstandings and relearning concepts** ensures deep learning. Once students re-learn the material, they record themselves again—this time truly grasping the underlying concepts.

## Dustin’s Application in Reading Training
Dustin applies the same technique in reading training: students must **explain each sentence in very simple terms**. If their explanation is fragmented, unnatural, or resembles machine translation, it indicates a lack of proper comprehension. Using this approach, Terminator has successfully helped many students **improve their foundational reading skills, ultimately boosting their Verbal and Data Insights scores.**

## Conclusion & Learning Advice
Start applying this method today:  
Try explaining a GMAT question as if you were teaching it to someone completely unfamiliar with the test. Then, listen to your own recording. Reflect: **Would a beginner understand this explanation?** If not, refine your reasoning. If you find gaps, vague logic, or difficulties in forming a coherent explanation, that’s where you need to compare your approach with expert solutions and refine your understanding.

**This is the Terminator approach to reviewing with the Feynman technique. Why not try it yourself and experience the depth and value of this learning method?**
