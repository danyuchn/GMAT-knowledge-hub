# Changes in GMAT Scores Relative to Percentile Rankings

## Key Points to Understand First

1. Your scaled score reflects your true ability and doesn't change.
2. Percentile rankings compare your score to test-takers from the past five years, showing where you rank among every 100 people. This can change at any time. The percentile on your score report may differ if you check it right after the exam versus one or two weeks later.
3. Schools place more emphasis on percentile rankings because only percentiles can be properly compared with performance on the old test format.

## Current Data Analysis

You can observe that:

* Quant (Q) percentiles have slightly decreased for scores below 86.
* Verbal (V) percentiles have significantly decreased in the high score range (90-85) and slightly decreased in the middle to low score ranges.
* Data Insights (DI) percentiles have generally decreased for scores below 85 according to the latest data.

## What This Means

There are several possible explanations:

1. Test-takers' overall performance has improved.
2. The difficulty of exam questions has decreased.
3. The number of test-takers has increased, with newer test-takers performing better.
4. Scoring standards have become more lenient.

Regardless of the cause, all these possibilities tell us that "taking the GMAT is like rowing against the current—if you don't advance, you fall behind." You now need to work harder to outperform more test-takers in this increasingly competitive environment.
