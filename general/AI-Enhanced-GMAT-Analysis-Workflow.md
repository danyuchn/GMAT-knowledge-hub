# Collaborating with AI: Optimizing My GMAT Tutoring Analysis Workflow

When you start thinking about "collaborating" with AI instead of fearing it’ll replace you, you’re already ahead of 90% of people. Here’s how I recently integrated AI into the most data-heavy part of my GMAT tutoring: the consultation and guidance process.

## Background
I’ve been experimenting with AI to boost my efficiency, not to fully automate my work.

- **Common Mindset**:  
  - Can AI analyze everything automatically?  
  - Can I just sit back and do nothing?  
- **My Approach**:  
  - How can AI assist my analysis?  
  - Can it highlight where I’m falling short?

Here’s the journey of how I revamped my workflow.

## Original Workflow
Before, analyzing a student’s score sheet looked like this:

- **Steps**:  
  1. Manually review the Excel score sheet.  
  2. Highlight key areas with colors (red, yellow, green) by hand.  
  3. Take notes while marking, all manually.  

- **Issues**:  
  - Inconsistent formatting and messy notes.  
  - Risk of missing critical analysis points.  
  - Time per student: ~**1 hour**.

## Improvement Process
I iterated on the process with these steps:

### 1. Recording My Thought Process
- Recorded myself explaining my analysis logic as I worked.  

### 2. AI-Assisted Pattern Recognition
- Transcribed recordings into text files and fed them, along with my notes, into AI as samples.  
- Asked AI to compare samples and identify consistent logic patterns.

### 3. Standardizing My SOP
- Organized my analysis approach into a structured Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  
- Formalized, standardized, and principled my process.  

### 4. Automating Highlights
- Defined key data points I focus on in score sheets based on my analysis habits.  
- Wrote a VBA macro to auto-highlight with one click.

## Current Workflow
Here’s how it works now:

1. **Run the Macro**:  
   - Open the Excel score sheet, execute the VBA macro, and see key areas auto-highlighted.

2. **Follow the SOP**:  
   - Use the AI-organized SOP to analyze the sheet step-by-step—structured and thorough.

3. **Record and Output**:  
   - Record my analysis live instead of typing.  
   - Post-recording, generate recommendations using a preset template. AI flags potential gaps in my logic for me to address.

## Results
- **Efficiency**: Time reduced by **60%**, with a smooth, comfortable process.  
- **Quality**: Comprehensive analysis, no missed points, 100% driven by my expertise.  
- **Output**: Clean, consistent format—easy for students to understand and act on.

## Conclusion
Think of it like being a mechanic: you can rely solely on raw experience, or you can standardize your expertise into an SOP. The latter cuts out meaningless repetition and makes your knowledge scalable and transferable.
