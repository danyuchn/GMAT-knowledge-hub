# Overall Key Strategies for GMAT Focus 

## Topic 1: Allocating Limited Time Across Subjects
We first explore how to distribute limited time across subjects and identify those with the highest return on investment. Whether it’s a mock or official exam, the first page displays the *total score*, comprising two components: **scale score** and **percentile**. The scale score ranges from 60 to 90 (30 increments), serving as a fixed, absolute metric. Percentiles, however, fluctuate based on rankings among all candidates from the past five years. For example, revisiting your results after two years, the scale score remains unchanged, but the percentile might shift.

So, which matters more? During admissions, schools focus on percentiles rather than raw numbers, as scale scores between the new and old systems (e.g., 645 in the new system ≠ 780 in the old) aren’t directly comparable. Scale scores reflect your true ability, but percentiles are what schools prioritize.

We provide a scale score-to-percentile chart: the x-axis is the scale score, the y-axis is the percentile, forming a cumulative curve. Three lines represent: black (DI), red (Math), blue (Verbal). Take a candidate with Math 85, Verbal 81, and DI 81. Plotting these, we analyze the tangent slope. A steeper slope means each scale score point boosts the percentile more. For this candidate, Verbal (blue) has the steepest slope—1 point raises the percentile by 10, versus 5 for other subjects. Thus, we recommend allocating 50% of study time to Verbal, 25% to DI, and 25% to Math for optimal results.

## Topic 2: Arranging Exam Subject Order
Many candidates ask about the order of Math, DI, and Verbal. The official video *What You Don’t Know About the GMAT Focus Edition* (45:44-47:11) reveals that the starting difficulty of the second and third sections depends on prior section performance. For instance, strong Math performance raises the Verbal section’s starting difficulty; weaker Math lowers it. This adjustment ensures accuracy despite reduced question counts, leveraging inter-subject correlations.

The recommended strategy is **"strongest subject first"**. Place your best subject first to enter a high-scoring zone early, boosting overall chances—like shooting from the three-point line in basketball for maximum returns.

## Topic 3: Impact of Rapid Responses
For Asian or Taiwanese candidates, strong Math skills may lead to overly quick answers. The system flags abnormally fast responses as potential blind guesses or cheating. A 2019 official slide highlights anomalies: high-difficulty questions answered correctly, low-difficulty ones missed, or correct answers at extreme speeds, suggesting unfair advantages. It tracks response time patterns, flagging 3-4 consecutive rapid answers.

Consequences aren’t explicitly defined but may involve score exclusion or soft penalties. To mitigate risks, even if you solve quickly, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute—especially in Math. Slow responses raise no suspicion, but speed could trigger scrutiny.

## Topic 4: Penalties for Unfinished Questions
Unfinished questions (not submitted via "Next"), common in Verbal or DI, incur penalties. Last year’s seminar clarified that deductions are proportional to the total scale score range of 60-90 (30 increments). For example, in Math (21 questions), 1 unfinished question deducts 1.4 points; Verbal, 1.3 points; DI, 1.5 points. One unfinished Math question drops percentiles by ~7 points, Verbal by ~15. Compared to wrong answers (1-2 percentile loss), this is far harsher. Always guess to complete all questions.

## Topic 5: Suggested Time Limits per Question
The exam features seven question types, grouped into three categories:
- **Small Questions (CR, PS, DS)**: Low word count, recommended 1.5-2 minutes. Use the exam countdown clock to estimate cutoffs.
- **Medium Questions (TPA, GT)**: Dual-column or chart-based with two sub-questions, suggested 2.5-3 minutes.
- **Large Questions (RC, MSR)**: RC (3 questions: 6 minutes; 4 questions: 8 minutes), MSR (2-3 pages: 6 minutes). Calculate deadlines upon encountering each question.

## Topic 6: Time Strategies Across Early, Middle, and Late Stages
Data shows exams split into early, middle, and late stages with varying volatility. The early stage has the highest fluctuation:
1. Avoid carelessness—verify Math or DI Math-heavy questions to prevent misjudgment from rapid solving.
2. For uncertainties, try multiple methods (e.g., plugging in numbers) rather than marking for later, as early errors affect subsequent difficulty.

In the middle stage, stick to normal timing; if exceeded (e.g., CR 2 minutes), guess and move on. In the late stage, prioritize completing all questions, abandoning low-confidence ones early if time is tight.

## Topic 7: Changes in Question Sequencing
In the last 1-2 months, question order shifted. Verbal may now feature 3 consecutive RC passages (previously interspersed); CR might run 5-6 in a row. For DI, DS speed should target 1.5-2 minutes with high accuracy. Train endurance: practice 3-4 RC passages consecutively and 5 CR questions in a set.

## Topic 8: Score Report Analysis
Within 76 hours post-exam, you receive an interactive score report (Cression, Response Time, etc.). Analysis steps:
1. **Sort by Question Order**: Check if final questions were rushed, excluding guesses.
2. **Sort by Response Time**: Fast and wrong (<1 minute) flags carelessness for verification; long times (>2.5 minutes) highlight weaknesses (e.g., word problems).
3. **Sort by Performance**: Assess accuracy-time correlation, excluding rushed questions, to pinpoint error causes.
4. **Sort by Fundamental Skills**: Identify weak areas (e.g., sequences, ratios).

Advanced analysis with data tools simulates difficulty and score shifts, spotting anomalies like easy questions missed or hard ones nailed for targeted review.
