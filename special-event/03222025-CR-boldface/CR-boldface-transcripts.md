# GMAN Seminar Summary: Mastering Boldface Questions (2025/03/23)

## Boldface Question Characteristics and Challenges
- **Text Length**: Typically 1.5–2x longer than standard CR questions (around 120–140 words), often spanning 4–5 sentences, compared to CR’s 80–100 words (~4 lines). Features multiple perspectives, increasing comprehension load, especially for non-native speakers or those with weaker reading stamina.
- **Abstract Options**: Options frequently include logical terms (e.g., `conclusion`, `premise`, `evidence`, `assumption`, `contention`) and abstract nouns, requiring familiarity with logical relationships (e.g., conclusion-to-evidence derivation). Untrained users struggle to differentiate options due to unfamiliar terms like `judgment basis` or `content evidence`.
- **Cracking Edge**: Options exhibit structural similarity (e.g., "The first is [core term]..."), not fully independent sentences. This allows systematic classification and comparison to pinpoint differences, then validate against the text—more structured than typical CR or RC questions.

## Five Principles for Solving Boldface Questions
1. **Start with Options, Then Text**:
   - Skip traditional approaches like reading the text first or scanning for transitional words. Begin with options to avoid aimless reading and redundant backtracking.
   - Goal: Establish a clear judgment benchmark for text analysis.
2. **Compare Option Differences**:
   - Treat the 5 options as a set, comparing vertically (not horizontally) to identify similarities and variances (e.g., core terms or modifiers).
   - Use differences to target relevant text segments, avoiding line-by-line analysis for efficiency.
3. **Focus on Core Nouns**:
   - Prioritize core terms (e.g., `premise`, `conclusion`, `assumption`) due to their brevity and clear definitions, simplifying differentiation.
   - Modifiers often shift tone (e.g., "support" vs. "weaken"), causing confusion—handle them after core terms. Example: "a premise used to support" vs. "a premise used to weaken" requires text context.
4. **Distinguish Objective vs. Subjective and Tone**:
   - Objective/subjective first: Identify via phrasing (e.g., "must have been" = subjective speculation; simple statements = objective facts), no immediate context needed.
   - Tone (pro/con) second: Requires context (e.g., "because" = causal, "however" = contrast), more complex, tackled post-core analysis.
5. **Prioritize Clarity, Dodge Ambiguity**:
   - Act on clear differences backed by text evidence; skip ambiguous cases (e.g., both options plausible) for gradual elimination.
   - Avoid forced judgments to minimize errors, especially under time constraints.

## Tools to Boost Skills
1. **Logical Mind Mapping**:
   - Use AI (e.g., GPT-4o, Grok) to input text and generate a logic map, labeling each sentence’s role (e.g., conclusion, reason, evidence) and relationships.
   - Analyze by clause (not full sentence), as Boldface often targets clauses. Draft manually first, then cross-check with AI.
   - Preferred model: Grok slightly outperforms Claude; free versions suffice.
2. **Option Term Explainer**:
   - Feed options into AI for definitions and usage of logical terms (e.g., "premise = reason behind conclusion", "assumption = subjective inference").
   - Addresses unfamiliarity with terms like `contention` or `evidence`, enhancing option comprehension.
3. **Speech-to-Text and Self-Diagnosis**:
   - Tools: Mac Whisper (Mac) or Whisper Desktop (Windows), free models work for clear recordings.
   - Record solving process (e.g., option comparison, text logic), convert to text, and compare with a standard workflow to spot gaps or errors.
   - Transcripts can be fed to AI for error analysis and improvement tips.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Standard Solving Workflow Demo](https://github.com/danyuchn/GMAT-prompt/blob/main/Verbal-related/06_boldface_SOP.md): Boldface SOP reference.
     - [Error Correction Prompt](https://github.com/danyuchn/GMAT-prompt/blob/main/Verbal-related/05_evaluate_explanation.md): Aligns and corrects solving steps.
4. **Interactive Practice**:
   - Input text sentence-by-sentence into AI, analyzing each sentence’s role (e.g., supports conclusion, provides context) and its ties to prior/next sentences, with AI feedback and corrections.
   - Mimics exam scenarios, training users to link marked sentences to options, sharpening info retrieval.
   - Builds long-term sensitivity to logical structure, transferable to Boldface, RC, and BetaInSign questions.
