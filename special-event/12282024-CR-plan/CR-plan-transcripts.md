# GMAT Evaluation of Plan Question Type Analysis and Strategies

## Overview

This document records a seminar on the "Evaluation of Plan" question type in the GMAT Critical Reasoning (CR) section, which accounts for over one-third of CR questions. The seminar uses high-difficulty questions from *GMAT Advanced Questions* to help candidates understand GMAT design logic and develop solving strategies.

## Characteristics of GMAT Evaluation of Plan Questions

- **Business-Oriented**: As a business school entrance exam, GMAT simulates decision-making scenarios to test evaluation skills.
- **Question Categories**: The Official Guide (OG) classifies CR questions into types, with "Evaluation of Plan" focusing on plan assessment.
- **Difficulty Sources**: 
  - Content may not be complex, but option design is highly deceptive.
  - Requires quick identification of key points under time pressure.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

Dustin proposes a five-step, thinking-oriented process emphasizing the "role immersion" method throughout:

1. **Analyze the Question Stem Carefully**: Defines the evaluation target.
2. **Immerse in a Role**: Adopt the perspective of a stakeholder, grounded in the scenario.
3. **Prethink**: Establish the role’s key concerns or KPIs before viewing options.
4. **First-Round Quick Filtering**: Filter options from the role’s perspective.
5. **Second-Round Detailed Check**: Confirm alignment with the question stem and plan.

## Example Question Analyses

Below are detailed analyses of all seven seminar questions, with option filtering explicitly from the immersed role’s perspective.

### Question 1: Wildlife Officials’ Snakehead Plan

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following would be most useful in evaluating the likelihood that the wildlife officials' plan will succeed?

**Passage**:  
Northern Snakeheads, an invasive species with no local predators, were found in North American rivers. For three years, officials paid amateur fishers to catch them, aiming to curb population growth and protect rare native species.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Evaluate the plan’s success likelihood, defined as achieving its goals (curbing snakehead growth, protecting rare species).
- **Role Immersion**: Supervisor of the officials, tasked with reviewing the plan’s effectiveness.
- **Prethink**: As the supervisor, I care about:
  1. Whether snakehead numbers decrease.
  2. Whether rare species are protected.
- **Option Filtering (Supervisor’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: Whether snakehead numbers decreased due to introducing predators  
    - I’m assessing paid fishing, not predators—irrelevant, eliminate.
  - **B**: Changes in rare fish populations since paying fishers  
    - I need to know if my plan protects rare fish—directly relevant, keep.
  - **C**: Whether fish preyed on by snakeheads in their native regions declined recently  
    - I care about my local results, and this is pre-plan data—useless, eliminate.
  - **D**: Number of snakeheads caught  
    - I want wild population reduction, not just catch numbers (they might reproduce faster)—off-target, eliminate.
  - **E**: Whether rare fish face other threats  
    - I’m only reviewing the snakehead plan, not other issues—out of scope, eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem focuses on "plan" success; B ties directly to paid fishing outcomes, unlike A’s unrelated method.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **B**.

### Question 2: City Parking Fee Plan

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest rebuttal to Taylor’s objection to the city’s plan?

**Passage**:  
Taylor argues that installing parking meters will drive customers away due to fees. The city plans to use fees to improve parking space efficiency.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Rebut Taylor’s objection (customers will leave), proving the plan won’t fail.
- **Role Immersion**: Customer, considering "under what conditions would I stay?"
- **Prethink**: As a customer, I’d stay if:
  1. Fees don’t bother me much.
  2. Leaving costs more (time/money).
- **Option Filtering (Customer’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: I hate searching for spots more than paying  
    - I’d rather pay than waste time—matches my stay condition, keep.
  - **B**: City adds parking time limits  
    - I’d be annoyed by restrictions; doesn’t help me stay—eliminate.
  - **C**: I rarely shop elsewhere now  
    - My current habit doesn’t mean I won’t leave after fees—irrelevant, eliminate.
  - **D**: Community already has paid lots  
    - I know that, but how does new fees affect me? Unclear—eliminate.
  - **E**: Nearby free parking has no limits  
    - I’d go there if it’s free and easy—supports Taylor, eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem seeks Taylor’s rebuttal; A proves I’d stay from my view, C is just current state.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **A**.

### Question 3: School Music Composition Suggestion

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the claim that implementing the suggestion will not lead to the desired success?

**Passage**:  
Adults lack appreciation for compositional beauty due to an elementary focus on visual arts over music. Educators suggest teaching students composition to improve appreciation.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Weaken the plan, showing composition teaching won’t achieve appreciation.
- **Role Immersion**: Student, opposing "learning composition makes me appreciate music."
- **Prethink**: As a student, I think learning skills doesn’t mean I’ll appreciate beauty.
- **Option Filtering (Student’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: I rarely create great compositions  
    - My skill level doesn’t affect appreciation—irrelevant, eliminate.
  - **B**: Visual arts education didn’t make me appreciate paintings  
    - I learned art but still don’t get it—same with music, keep.
  - **C**: More people enjoy music than art  
    - I don’t care what others like; doesn’t affect my learning—eliminate.
  - **D**: Some composers never studied composition  
    - I’m about learning’s effect, not bypassing it—eliminate.
  - **E**: Suggestion based on three-school study  
    - I don’t care about study origins; doesn’t prove my point—eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem needs plan failure proof; B weakens causality from my experience, C is unrelated.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **B**.

### Question 4: Farmer’s Response to Grain Quota

**Question Stem**:  
> Suppose an individual farmer in country R wishes to minimize the impact on profits of the grain quota whose eventual imposition is being predicted. Which should the farmer do now?

**Passage**:  
Farmers sell unsold crops to a committee at a guaranteed price, but a future quota will limit production to a fixed percentage of past output to curb overproduction.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Find the farmer’s current action to minimize profit impact from the quota.
- **Role Immersion**: Farmer, aiming to protect profits.
- **Prethink**: As a farmer, I’d:
  1. Boost pre-quota output for a higher future limit.
  2. Sell independently to avoid quota restrictions.
- **Option Filtering (Farmer’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: I retire unprofitable fields  
    - I’d lose some profit; not ideal but reduces loss—keep cautiously.
  - **B**: I lock in future prices  
    - I might avoid losses, but high or low price? Uncertain—keep.
  - **C**: I buy a new harvester  
    - I’d spend more and can’t sell excess—useless, eliminate.
  - **D**: I cultivate marginal land to boost output  
    - I increase pre-quota yield, raising my limit—perfect, keep.
  - **E**: I negotiate with others to cut production  
    - I drag others down but don’t save myself—eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem wants impact minimized; D clearly boosts my profit, B’s price direction is vague.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **D**.

### Question 5: Waste Recycling Proposal

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the advisability of implementing the proposal?

**Passage**:  
Recycling is seen as more eco-friendly and profitable than incineration or burial. A legislator proposes mandating 50% waste recycling in communities within five years.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Question the proposal’s advisability (ineffective, side effects, infeasible).
- **Role Immersion**: Community resident, opposing mandatory recycling.
- **Prethink**: As a resident, I doubt:
  1. Recycling rates won’t rise.
  2. It’ll cause issues (e.g., cost).
  3. It’s impractical.
- **Option Filtering (Resident’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: Current participation varies  
    - I don’t care who recycles now; future matters—eliminate.
  - **B**: Only 20% of recycling is profitable now  
    - I see 50% won’t pay off, so why bother?—keep.
  - **C**: Small volumes make buyers scarce now  
    - I think bigger volumes will sell better—helps them, eliminate.
  - **D**: Some recyclables pollute little anyway  
    - I say old ways work too, but doesn’t trash recycling—eliminate.
  - **E**: Non-recyclables are hard to burn  
    - I don’t care about the other 50%—irrelevant, eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem seeks doubts; B undercuts profit from my view, C supports the plan.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **B**.

### Question 6: River Diversion Plan

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following, if true, most effectively identifies a weakness in the plan described in the passage?

**Passage**:  
Declining river levels cause saltwater intrusion; 40% of water is diverted to towns. The plan stops diversion to protect the river, though it may raise water costs or reduce supply.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Identify a plan weakness (ineffective, costly, infeasible).
- **Role Immersion**: Water company, opposing the diversion halt.
- **Prethink**: As the company, I argue:
  1. Diversion doesn’t affect levels.
  2. It’s too costly to stop.
  3. It’s unworkable.
- **Option Filtering (Water Company’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: I can purify salty water  
    - I’d cope, not critique the plan—eliminate.
  - **B**: Levels are just one salinity factor  
    - I say you’re missing other causes—keep.
  - **C**: Upstream is dam-controlled  
    - I see upstream’s covered, but what about downstream?—eliminate.
  - **D**: Town populations are growing  
    - I need more water, so don’t stop—opposite direction, eliminate.
  - **E**: Level drop was drought-driven, now over  
    - I say the problem’s gone, your plan’s pointless—keep.
- **Second Check**: Stem wants a weakness; E proves it’s unnecessary from my view, B’s factor weight is unclear.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **E**.

### Question 7: Brainwave Device Evaluation

**Question Stem**:  
> Which of the following would be most useful in evaluating whether the device can effectively achieve its intended purpose?

**Passage**:  
A device scans brainwaves, comparing them to 15,000 samples, to help doctors decide if injured athletes can return to the field.

**Analysis**:
- **Question Stem Analysis**: Assess if the device effectively meets its goal (judging athlete status).
- **Role Immersion**: Doctor, needing accurate and fast decisions.
- **Prethink**: As a doctor, I need:
  1. Accurate judgments.
  2. Quick judgments.
- **Option Filtering (Doctor’s Perspective)**:
  - **A**: Is the database updated?  
    - I need current data for accuracy—keep.
  - **B**: Can I make sound decisions before the game ends?  
    - I need both accuracy and speed—ideal, keep.
  - **C**: Do experts endorse it?  
    - I care about results, not opinions—eliminate.
  - **D**: Does it include same-game teammates’ data?  
    - I just need good samples, not specific ones—eliminate.
  - **E**: Have I misjudged before?  
    - My errors don’t judge the device—eliminate.
- **Second Check**: Stem seeks effectiveness; B meets my full needs, A only covers accuracy.
- **Conclusion**: Answer is **B**.

## Common Distractor Types

1. **Goal-Related but Plan-Irrelevant**: e.g., predators (Q1 A).
2. **Wrong Time Frame**: e.g., pre-plan data (Q1 C).
3. **Unclear Direction**: e.g., unspecified price level (Q4 B).
