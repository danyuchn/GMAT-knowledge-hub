# Lecture Summary: GMAT CR Seminar - Scheme Purpose Questions and Problem-Solving Strategies

## Theme Introduction: Scheme Purpose Questions in GMAT CR

The lecture centers on **Scheme Purpose Questions** (or "Evaluation of Plan" questions), which Dustin estimates comprise over one-third of CR items in the Official Guide (OG). He ties their prevalence to GMAT’s role as a business school test, emphasizing decision-making in commercial-like scenarios—think wildlife policies or city planning—over abstract logic puzzles. Sourcing examples from the *GMAT Advanced Questions* book, a high-difficulty collection, he promises to unpack GMAT’s design, including tricky distractors and time-pressure tactics.

## Dustin’s Core Problem-Solving Framework

Dustin champions a streamlined, thought-driven approach over rigid rules or micro-classifications, unveiling five key strategies applied across seven questions:

1. **Analyze the Question Stem Carefully**: The stem is king—misinterpreting it even slightly can lead astray, a principle spanning CR, RC, and DI (e.g., DSR, TPA).
2. **Adopt a Stakeholder Role**: For scheme questions, “substitution thinking” means stepping into a stakeholder’s shoes—preferably the decision-maker or affected party—to ground the problem.
3. **Prethink Before Options**: Treat the question as open-ended first, defining success metrics or KPIs (e.g., “What matters to me in this role?”) before seeing choices.
4. **Screen Options with Prethink**: Use these metrics for a swift first-pass filter, avoiding repetitive passage rereads.
5. **Final Check with Key Issue**: Revisit the stem or passage’s core issue for a second-round check, ensuring scheme alignment.

He contrasts this with overly complex frameworks, which falter under exam stress, and attendees signal comprehension with a chat “E.”

## Detailed Question Demonstrations

Dustin demonstrates his framework with seven high-difficulty questions, emphasizing role substitution and prethinking. Below are expanded analyses for key examples:

### Question 1: Wildlife Officials and Snakeheads
- **Passage**: Northern snakeheads, an invasive fish with no local predators in North American rivers, threaten rare native species. For three years, wildlife officials paid recreational fishers to catch them, aiming to curb population growth and protect biodiversity.
- **Question**: “Which of the following would be most useful in evaluating the likelihood that the wildlife officials’ plan will succeed?”
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Step 1: Question Stem Analysis**: Dustin dissects “likelihood of success,” noting “success” means achieving the dual goals—halting snakehead growth and safeguarding rare fish. The stem demands a factor tied to the plan’s effectiveness.
  - **Step 2: Role Substitution**: He rejects the official’s perspective (too self-assured) and the fishers’ (merely hired hands), opting for the supervisor overseeing the officials. “I’m the boss,” he says, “judging if my team’s plan works.”
  - **Step 3: Prethinking**: As the supervisor, Dustin asks, “What would I need to see to call this a win? Fewer snakeheads in the rivers—say, a 20% drop in sightings—and more rare fish surviving, maybe their numbers stabilizing or rising.” These KPIs become his yardstick.
  - **Step 4: Option Screening**: 
    - A: “Whether snakehead numbers decreased via predators” aligns with fewer snakeheads but introduces an unrelated method, not the payment plan—reserved but suspect.
    - B: “How rare fish populations changed since payments began” directly measures the plan’s impact on a key goal—reserved.
    - C: “Whether snakehead prey declined decades ago” uses pre-plan data, irrelevant to current success—discarded.
    - D: “How many snakeheads were caught” tracks effort, not outcome (numbers could rise despite catches)—discarded.
    - E: “Other threats to rare fish” is outside the plan’s scope—discarded.
  - **Step 5: Final Check**: Revisiting “plan will succeed,” Dustin stresses the payment scheme’s causal link. A fails (predators aren’t the plan), while B ties fish recovery to payments, winning out.

### Question 2: City Parking Meters
- **Passage**: Taylor argues scarce parking deters shoppers in a community; the city plans meters to boost turnover, but Taylor predicts fees will drive shoppers away.
- **Question**: “Which, if true, most logically rebuts a proponent of the city’s plan would make to Taylor’s objection?”
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Step 1: Question Stem Analysis**: “Rebut Taylor’s objection” means countering “shoppers will leave due to fees,” from the plan’s advocate’s view.
  - **Step 2: Role Substitution**: Dustin starts as a city official but pivots to a shopper—“If I’m the official, I’d convince Taylor by thinking like the people affected.” As a shopper, he embodies the plan’s target.
  - **Step 3: Prethinking**: “Why would I, a shopper, stay despite fees? Maybe they’re cheap—$1 won’t break me—or searching for free spots wastes more time and gas, or the mall offers parking discounts with purchases.” These scenarios shape his filter.
  - **Step 4: Option Screening**: 
    - A: “Shoppers dislike searching more than paying” matches the “less hassle” prethink—reserved.
    - B: “Meters limit parking time” confuses intent (is it free or paid?)—discarded.
    - C: “Shoppers rarely shop elsewhere now” hints at loyalty but reflects pre-meter habits—reserved.
    - D: “Community already has paid lots” ignores the new plan’s effect—discarded.
    - E: “Nearby free lots have no limits” suggests shoppers would flee—opposite intent, discarded.
  - **Step 5: Final Check**: The stem seeks a rebuttal tied to the meter plan’s future. C’s “now” is pre-scheme, while A’s preference for paying over searching directly counters Taylor’s flight prediction, making A the answer.

### Question 3: Music Education Proposal
- **Passage**: Adults lack music appreciation due to limited school music education compared to visual arts. Educators propose teaching composition to foster appreciation.
- **Question**: “Which, if true, most strongly suggests implementing the proposal won’t succeed?”
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Step 1: Question Stem Analysis**: “Won’t succeed” means the plan fails to achieve appreciation, requiring a weakening factor.
  - **Step 2: Role Substitution**: Dustin bypasses educators (pro-plan) for a critic—first a parent, then a student: “As a kid forced to learn composition, I’d be closest to the outcome.”
  - **Step 3: Prethinking**: As a student, he muses, “If I learn to compose, will I automatically love Beethoven? Maybe I’d master scales but still find it dull—technique doesn’t guarantee passion.” He seeks a disconnect between skill and appreciation.
  - **Step 4: Option Screening**: 
    - A: “Few kids compose great works” focuses on output, not enjoyment—discarded.
    - B: “Visual arts education doesn’t ensure appreciation” parallels music, suggesting composition won’t spark love—reserved.
    - C: “More enjoy music than art” shows appreciation exists but not via the plan—discarded.
    - D: “Some composers didn’t study composition” addresses creation, not appreciation—discarded.
    - E: “Proposal based on three schools” questions sampling, not efficacy—discarded.
  - **Step 5: Final Check**: B’s analogy—learning art doesn’t guarantee liking it—directly undermines the plan’s logic, winning as the strongest weakener.

### Quiz Question: Farmer’s Quota Strategy
- **Passage**: In Rzeg, unsold crops are bought at guaranteed prices. Imminent quotas will cap production at a fixed fraction of past yields to curb overproduction.
- **Question**: “Which should the farmer do now to minimize profit impact?”
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Step 1: Question Stem Analysis**: “Minimize profit impact” seeks a proactive step to offset quota losses, tied to the farmer’s actions.
  - **Step 2: Role Substitution**: Dustin becomes the farmer: “I’m growing crops, facing cuts—my profits are at stake.”
  - **Step 3: Prethinking**: “Quotas are past yield times a discount—say, 60% of last year’s 100 tons becomes 60 tons. If I boost this year’s yield to 200 tons, 60% is 120 tons—more to sell. Or I could sell elsewhere, dodging quotas.” He prioritizes inflating pre-quota output.
  - **Step 4: Option Screening**: 
    - A: “Retire unprofitable fields” shrinks yield, worsening cuts—reserved but flawed.
    - B: “Lock future prices” stabilizes income but lacks high/low clarity—reserved.
    - C: “New harvester” boosts harvest but not sales under quotas—discarded.
    - D: “Cultivate unused land” spikes pre-quota yield, raising future caps—reserved.
    - E: “Negotiate group cuts” spreads loss, not minimizing it—discarded.
  - **Step 5: Final Check**: A reduces quotas, B’s price fix is vague, but D ensures higher quotas (e.g., 120 vs. 60 tons), directly minimizing impact. D wins, correcting most attendees’ B choice.

### Final Question: Brainwave Scanner
- **Passage**: A device scans brainwaves against 15,000 samples to gauge concussion severity, helping doctors decide if athletes can return to play.
- **Question**: “Which best evaluates if the device effectively achieves its purpose?”
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Step 1: Question Stem Analysis**: “Effectively achieves” means aiding accurate, timely return-to-play calls.
  - **Step 2: Role Substitution**: Dustin picks the doctor: “I’m on the sideline, athlete’s down—can this gadget help me decide fast?”
  - **Step 3: Prethinking**: “I need it right—sending a concussed player back risks injury—and quick, before the game’s over. Maybe it misreads old data or takes too long—accuracy and speed are my KPIs.”
  - **Step 4: Option Screening**: 
    - A: “Are samples updated?” ensures accuracy but not speed—reserved.
    - B: “Can it decide correctly before match end?” hits both KPIs—reserved.
    - C: “Expert endorsement” is irrelevant to function—discarded.
    - D: “Same-game teammate data” isn’t essential for accuracy—discarded.
    - E: “Past doctor errors” blames humans, not the device—discarded.
  - **Step 5: Final Check**: B’s dual focus (correctness and timing) outshines A’s singular accuracy, aligning with the device’s purpose.

## Common Distractor Patterns

Dustin flags three GMAT distractor traps:
1. **Scheme-Irrelevant Factors**: Goal-related but plan-unlinked (e.g., predators in Q1).
2. **Time Misalignment**: Pre-scheme data (e.g., decades-ago fish in Q1).
3. **Ambiguous Direction**: Unclear impact (e.g., fixed prices in Quiz).
