# Analyzing the New "Data Sufficiency non-math Questions"

## Introduction: The Emergence and Challenges of a New Question Type

Hello, everyone! I’m Dustin, and today we’re here to talk about something special. Our seminar today is completely different from anything we’ve done before. Starting now, we’ll have two seminars a month, each with a different theme. Today’s theme is something many of you have been asking about—a topic you’ve been knocking on the table for, something you’re really curious about: the new question type in GMAX Mindset that’s different from the old format. Specifically, it’s the "Data Sufficiency Text Questions" (we’ll call them DS Text Questions). This is a brand-new addition, and a lot of you have been asking, “What’s this all about? How do we tackle it in the exam? What are some good tricks to crack it?” So, we’ve prepared a bunch of questions—about 8 to 10—and we’ll work through them interactively. 

Since it’s interactive, I’ve got a cool feature ready. We’ve found it’s perfect for online Q&A like this. Why? Because it has a voting function! Later, when we solve these questions, we’ll use it to let you anonymously share your thoughts and pick your answers. Then, based on everyone’s responses right here in the room, we’ll go through and explain them step by step. Today’s theme is officially "DF-Begin-Standemount Non-Math-Rations"—fancy name, but it’s just these DS Text Questions.

### The Quiet Debut of DS Text Questions

Let me start with some background. This question type has an origin story, and it came with a little reminder. When it first popped up, it was super quiet—no one saw it coming. I even think there might’ve been a bit of a mistake involved. Why? Last April, GMAC announced a big overhaul of GMAX. In their detailed breakdown, we clearly saw that Data Sufficiency (DST) was being moved from its old spot—where it was all about pure math—to join the IR section, alongside chart questions and paginated problems. But back then, it was just a move. We didn’t know about this new twist. All the DST questions we’d seen before were math-based. Then, when the real exams hit, people started saying, “Wait, what’s this on my score report? There’s something called ‘Math’ questions, but they don’t feel like math—they’re more like logical reasoning, sufficiency stuff.” We were all stunned. Why? Because the OG they released in June after the overhaul didn’t have these questions! Every DST in that OG was still math-related. Students were confused, we were confused—no one could see what these new questions even looked like.

Later, because so many negative voices reached GMAC, they finally added a bunch of these DS Text Questions to the latest 2024-2025 OG this year. That’s why we can do this seminar now. So, apologies for being a bit late to the party, but we’ve got plenty to cover. From this year backward, this question type’s first year of life has been a testing phase. You don’t need to worry too much about it—why? When a new question is born, they test it. They don’t know if it’s good quality yet. How do they judge that? By putting it in real exams and seeing how the candidate pool performs. Do high-ability students get it right? Do lower-ability ones get it wrong? There needs to be a correlation, a statistical significance. If it’s not up to par, it doesn’t become an official scored question. Even if it passes, they use student performance to set its difficulty—only then does it go into the adaptive test pool, adjusting difficulty based on your ability. That whole process needs enough data, and a question has to go through enough testing. So, over the past year, when you saw these in exams, they were probably unscored test questions. But moving forward, who knows? They might’ve collected enough data already, so we need to start studying seriously now, okay?

## Core Concepts of DS Text Questions

### Basic Framework

Let’s review the basics. First off, there’s a question stem—sometimes it comes with some context, sometimes it’s just a straight question, long or short. What you need to figure out is: Can you give it a unique solution? Or can you definitively say "yes" or "no"—100% yes or 100% no? Note this: 100% "no" counts as sufficient too. If you can’t pin it down to one answer—if there are two or more possibilities, or some cases are "yes" and others "no"—that’s insufficient. The five answer choices? Don’t bother looking at them too hard. Why? They’re the same for every question. Here’s what they are:

1. **Condition 1 alone works, Condition 2 doesn’t.**
   - Condition 1 by itself is sufficient, Condition 2 alone isn’t.
2. **Condition 2 alone works, Condition 1 doesn’t.**
   - Condition 2 by itself is sufficient, Condition 1 alone isn’t.
3. **Neither alone works, but together they do.**
   - Both are insufficient individually, but combined they’re sufficient.
4. **Both work on their own.**
   - Condition 1 alone is sufficient, and Condition 2 alone is sufficient.
5. **Nothing works.**
   - No matter what—alone or together—they’re insufficient.

Got that? Anyone who understands what I just laid out, type an "E" for me. Let’s make sure we’re on the same page with this basic concept.

### Applying It to Non-Math DS Questions

Okay, now that we’ve reviewed, let’s see how this works with pure text-based DS questions—no math involved. We’ll start with a survey. I’m giving you one minute to solve this first question. Hang on—I’ll reset the poll. You’ve got one minute. Once you’re done, just hit the button. We’ll share results after one minute or when 75% of you have answered, whichever comes first. Oh, quick note: in the real exam, a question should take about one and a half to two minutes to solve. DI has 45 minutes for 20 questions—that’s 2 minutes 15 seconds per question on average. But for DI, I’d love you to go faster. Why? DS Text Questions have the least text, and the five options are always the same—you don’t need to read them every time. Other questions—like chart questions, two-column TPA, or multi-page MSR—those take longer. You want to bank time on these shorter ones to spend on the tougher stuff. Aim for 1.5 to 2 minutes on DS questions.

#### First Poll Results
Alright, let’s see your answers. Most people went with Option 1, but some picked A (21%) and C (22%). I won’t reveal the answer yet—let’s try another question first. Resetting the poll now—please do the second question. You’ve got 1 to 1.5 minutes. Go ahead and submit when you’re ready. Ten seconds left… Okay, here’s the result. Interesting—your answers are more scattered than the first time. The first question had a lot of E’s, now we’ve got C and E splitting the vote. This tells me something: you’re not using a key trick yet—Role-Playing.

## Solving Strategies: Role-Playing and Question Focus

### The Role-Playing Method

What’s Role-Playing? It’s putting yourself in the shoes of someone in the question and thinking, “How would I approach this?” It’s the go-to method for all DI questions—charts, MSR, and these DS Text Questions. Why? DI questions are always applied problems—case studies, stories—not pure math or abstract logic. You can’t role-play a math equation, but with a story, you can stretch this method to its fullest. Let’s try it.

#### Example: Visa Question Revisited
Say I’m a Taiwanese tourist heading to France, asking, “Do I need a visa?” I google it. First condition: "Schengen countries don’t need a visa for France." Cool, but what’s Schengen? Am I in it? I don’t know—Condition 1 alone isn’t enough. Second condition: "Taiwan isn’t a Schengen country." Okay, I’m not Schengen, but does that mean I need a visa? What’s Schengen got to do with it? Maybe Taiwan has its own deal—Condition 2 alone isn’t enough either. Together: Schengen folks don’t need visas, I’m not Schengen, but could there be another exemption? Still don’t know. Answer’s E.

Anyone get that? Type a "1" if you do. See how Role-Playing speeds things up? Let’s try another.

#### Example: Export Question Revisited
Now I’m an export manager at a company. Question: “Did we export to Indonesia?” Condition 1: "Association members all export to Indonesia." Am I in the association? Don’t know—insufficient. Condition 2: "We’re not in the association." Okay, but does that mean we can’t export? No rule says that—insufficient. Together: association exports, I’m not in it, but maybe I export anyway? Can’t tell—E again.

Notice a pattern? Role-Playing keeps your thinking structured. But I saw something in the second poll: more people picked C. That means some got stuck. What’s the snag? If you went from 1 on the first question to C on the second, or keep picking C, you’ve got a logic blind spot: you’re treating "if P then Q" as "if not P then not Q." That’s a no-go. "If it rains, the ground’s wet" doesn’t mean "if it doesn’t rain, the ground’s dry"—maybe a sprinkler got it wet. Same here: "Schengen = no visa" doesn’t mean "non-Schengen = visa." Watch that—it trips you up in CR, TPA, and DS.

### Question Focus

The question is everything. Let’s do another—Question 5. You’ve got 1.5 minutes. Go! Okay, 1.5 minutes up—only 50% answered. If you’re not done, heads-up: these should take 1.5 to 2 minutes in the exam. You’re in the danger zone. Results: 54% picked something, 31% picked 1, 15% picked something else. I won’t spoil it—let’s do Question 6, same deal, 1.5 minutes. Oops, typo—I meant “do,” not “peach garden,” haha. Alright, results: similar to before, but more picked 1.

#### Example: Quarantine Question Breakdown
Question: "Are all travelers with COVID-19 symptoms required to quarantine?" Condition 1: "Some COVID patients might not show symptoms on arrival." Condition 2: "Only high-fever travelers quarantine; COVID doesn’t always cause fever." I’m the quarantine chief—say, Chen Shih-chung. I care about everyone with symptoms. Condition 1 talks about no symptoms—question’s about those with symptoms, so it’s irrelevant. Insufficient. Condition 2: only fever gets you quarantined, but COVID has cough, no smell, etc. If I only catch fever, I miss others—clear "no, not all are quarantined." Sufficient. Answer’s B.

Why’d some pick E? You thought it has to be "yes" to be sufficient. Nope—if I prove "no" 100%, that’s sufficient too. Type a "1" if you get it. Role-Playing as the chief makes it clear: I ask, “If I see fever, do I catch them?” They say, “Some don’t have fever.” I don’t care—I want “if I see symptoms, do I catch them?”

### Time Check
These stories are real-life stuff with weird names—Yamanaka, Caspi—like Central Asian cities or Japanese mountains. They’re just dressed-up everyday scenarios. Role-Play as a character asking questions or digging for info—like googling visa rules or a quarantine officer grilling staff. It clears the fog.

## Practice Rounds

### Question 10: Travel Cost
- **Stem**: A restaurant meal costs M. Weekends over $80 get 15% off; there’s a $15 voucher.
- **Question**: Did A save more than B on the same meal?
- **Condition 1**: A used a $15 voucher, meal over $80.
- **Condition 2**: B used a voucher, spent $10 more than A.

#### Analysis
I’m A, comparing with B. Condition 1: I used a voucher, but what’d B spend? Can’t tell—insufficient. Condition 2: B spent $10 more with a voucher—I win, no math needed. Sufficient. Answer’s B. All that weekend discount stuff? Junk info to trick you into calculating. Don’t fall for it—focus on the question. Type a "1" if you get it.

#### Pitfalls
C folks: You tied 1 and 2 together, but 2 alone works. E folks: You thought it’s “every day,” but it’s just “did it happen once?” One time’s enough.

### Question 12: Psychology Debate
- **Question**: Can it be determined if psychology qualifies as a science?
- **Condition 1**: Some researchers say it uses scientific methods for behavior.
- **Condition 2**: Some critics say it can’t reproduce results, against science’s definition.

#### Analysis
I’m a fair judge. Condition 1: some say it’s science—opinion, not fact, insufficient. Condition 2: some say it’s not—same deal, insufficient. Together: I’ve got two sides yelling, no way to pick. E. B folks: you picked a side, but the question’s about “can I decide,” not “what’s true.”

### Question 14: Chair’s Discretion
- **Question**: Can the chair exercise discretion while following rules?
- **Condition 1**: Some chairs can.
- **Condition 2**: Some can while rule-abiding.

#### Analysis
I’m the chair—can I? Condition 1: some do—possible, sufficient. Condition 2: same thing, sufficient. Answer’s D. E folks: you overthought “possible”—one case proves it.

### Question 15: Bill Passing
- **Question**: Will Proposal X pass?
- **Condition 1**: 62% favor X.
- **Condition 2**: Poll’s representative.

#### Analysis
I’m the bill’s backer (Trump, maybe). Need “yes” or “no.” Condition 1: 62% like it—polls can lie, voters might skip, insufficient. Condition 2: good sample, no results—insufficient. Together: still shaky—can’t say for sure. E. It’s “will,” not “can.”

### Question 16: Vacation Spot
- **Question**: Where did Ocean and Rina go last year (F, G, J, K)?
- **Stem**: They pick unvisited spots, Rina’s choice unless Ocean’s been there. Rina’s hit F, G; Ocean’s hit J, K.
- **Condition 1**: Rina hasn’t been to J, Ocean hasn’t to F.
- **Condition 2**: Ocean wants G and K.

#### Analysis
I’m Ocean. F, G out (Rina’s been), J out (I’ve been). Condition 1: Rina hasn’t hit J—does she like it? Don’t know, insufficient. Condition 2: I like G, K—G’s out, my likes don’t matter, insufficient. Together: still no clue on J’s appeal. E.

### Question 17: Movie Night
- **Question**: Will Simon and Tara watch tonight?
- **Stem**: Movies are P, Q, T. Simon likes P-type, hates travel; Tara skips R, T.
- **Condition 1**: Q’s far.
- **Condition 2**: Nearby’s T only.

#### Analysis
I’m Simon—want P, Q. Tara’s cool with them. Condition 1: Q’s far—I’m out, P’s unknown, “no,” sufficient. Condition 2: nearby’s T—we both hate it, “no,” sufficient. D.

## Time Management

Real exam: 45 minutes, 20 questions—2:15 average. DS should be 1.5–2 minutes to save time for MSR or TPA. Don’t scribble numbers right away—get the question first.

## DI’s Three Traits

1. **Applied Problems**: Real stories—Role-Play integrates info.
2. **Wordy with Junk**: Traps abound—Role-Play filters them.
3. **Question Rules**: It’s the core—focus there.
