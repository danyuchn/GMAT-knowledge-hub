# Improving GMAT Verbal RC Accuracy: Question Types & Prethink Strategies

## Overview
- **Topic**: Enhancing performance in GMAT Verbal Reading Comprehension (RC).

  - Students understand passages but struggle with low accuracy.
  - Despite reviewing mistakes, errors persist in similar question types.
- **Goal**: Provide actionable strategies to tackle these issues by focusing on question type identification and correct reasoning.

## Core Issues and Solutions
- **Issue 1: Misinterpreting Question Requirements**
  - Do students carefully read and analyze question stems to grasp what’s being asked?
- **Issue 2: Faulty Reasoning**
  - After identifying the question type, do students reason correctly based on passage information?
- **Solutions**:
  - **Focus 1**: Learn to accurately identify question types.
  - **Focus 2**: Develop proper reasoning aligned with passage content.

# RC Question Types: Detailed Breakdown (Based on OG)

## 1. Main Idea (Main Theme Questions)
- **Description**:
  - Each passage has *one central focus* (termed "Single Unified Purpose" or "One Central Point" in OG).
  - Emphasizes the *author’s perspective*, not opinions of scholars mentioned in the text.
- **Question Formats**:
  - *Complete Sentence*: 
    - e.g., "Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main idea of the passage?"
    - Options are full sentences with subject (S) and verb (V).
  - *Incomplete Sentence*: 
    - e.g., "The primary purpose of the passage as a whole is to..."
    - Options start with verbs (e.g., "argue that..."), reflecting the author’s action or stance.
- **Key Strategies**:
  - **Author’s Presence**: Does the author explicitly appear and take a stance, or remain neutral?
  - **Author’s Stance**: If present, what’s the author’s position (e.g., support, critique)?
  - **Main Conclusion**: 
    - Defined as the statement all passage info points to, which cannot be further deduced into other conclusions.
    - Logic: Other sentences lead to it; it doesn’t lead elsewhere.
- **Passage Types**:
  - *Argumentative*: 
    - Find the main conclusion (e.g., a final point all arguments support).
    - Method: Identify the sentence that’s the endpoint of all reasoning.
  - *Presentative* (30%-40% of GMAT RC):
    - No argument; just facts or stories.
    - Method: Spot recurring themes across paragraphs (e.g., economic trends over decades, diplomatic attitudes across countries).

## 2. Supporting Idea (Detail Questions)
- **Description**:
  - Tests comprehension of *explicitly stated info* in the passage.
  - *No inference or assumptions allowed*—stick to what’s written.
  - May include details not endorsed by the author (e.g., opposing views).
- **Question Formats**:
  - Common opener: "According to the passage..."
  - Variants:
    - "Which of the following is mentioned by the author?"
    - "The passage compares..."
    - "The author uses X to refute..."
  - Uses *simple tense* (present or past), avoiding speculative terms like "may" or "likely."
- **Key Strategies**:
  - *No Brainstorming*: Base answers solely on evidence provided.
  - *Watch for Paraphrasing*: Options often rephrase passage terms (synonyms/antonyms); ensure conceptual equivalence.
- **Distinction**: Focuses on specific passage segments, unlike Main Idea’s whole-text scope.

## 3. Inference (Inference Questions)
- **Description**:
  - Targets info *not explicitly stated* but implied or logically deducible.
  - May require reasoning from a specific perspective (e.g., a scholar’s view, not the author’s).
  - Must rely on passage info, not external knowledge.
- **Question Formats**:
  - Direct: "What can be inferred from the passage?" / "The passage implies..."
  - Speculative Tone: 
    - "Which is most likely to be true?"
    - "X would agree with which of the following?"
    - Uses terms like "would," "may," signaling inference over fact.
- **Key Strategies**:
  - *Vs. Supporting Idea*: Requires logical extension beyond stated content.
  - *Perspective Matters*: Follow the question’s specified viewpoint.
  - *No Outside Knowledge*: Even if an option aligns with reality, it’s wrong if unprovable from the passage.
- **Example**: 
  - Passage says a theory is wrong; question asks, "If it were true, what follows?" Answer hinges on passage logic, not facts.

## 4. Evaluation (Evaluation Questions)
- **Subtypes**:
  1. **Analysis Type (Purpose Questions)**:
     - Examines the *role* of a passage segment and its *connection to context*.
     - **Formats**: 
       - "The purpose of paragraph 2 is to..."
       - "The author includes X to..."
     - **Strategies**:
       - Focus on *author’s intent*, not scholars’ views.
       - Analyze *contextual links* (e.g., does it introduce, refute, support?).
  2. **Critique Type (Logic Questions)**:
     - Mirrors CR tasks: strengthen, weaken, evaluate.
     - **Formats**: 
       - "Which strengthens the author’s argument?"
       - "Which weakens the conclusion?"
     - **Strategies**: Apply CR method—identify premise, build logic chain, ask critical questions (CQ).
- **Distinction**: Purpose questions target segment roles; Main Idea targets the entire passage.

## 5. Application (Application Questions)
- **Description**:
  - Tests ability to *abstract passage ideas* and apply them to *new scenarios*.
  - Least frequent in OG, with difficulty ranging from low to high.
- **Question Formats**:
  - *Analogy*: "Which is most analogous to the passage’s situation?"
  - *Rules*: Identify underlying principles.
  - *Continuation*: "If the passage continues, what’s next?"
  - *What-If*: "If scenario A becomes C, what happens per the passage?"
- **Key Strategies**:
  - *Abstraction*: Extract a general principle from the passage story.
  - *Cross-Domain Application*: Apply it to unrelated contexts (e.g., environmental logic to corporate governance).
  - *Vs. Inference*: Inference stays within the passage’s theme; Application leaps to new domains.
- **Example**: 
  - Passage on chemistry; options on physics—focus on the shared principle, not content.

# Solving and Reviewing RC Questions

## Solving Process
1. **Identify Question Type**:
   - Use question stem cues (e.g., "According to" = Supporting Idea, "implies" = Inference).
2. **Locate Passage Info**:
   - Pinpoint relevant text segments.
3. **Prethink (Pre-Answer)**:
   - Before options, draft your own answer as if it’s a short-response question.
   - **Benefits**:
     - *Prevents Option Bias*: Options are independent; without a pre-answer, you risk confusion.
     - *Speeds Screening*: Compare options to your standard efficiently.
4. **Match Options**:
   - Align your pre-answer with the closest option, eliminating mismatches.

## Review Process
- **Error Blind Spots**:
  1. **Passage Misinterpretation**:
     - Wrong section or misread content (e.g., "support" as "oppose").
  2. **Question Misunderstanding**:
     - Misjudged type (e.g., treating Inference as Supporting Idea).
     - Wrong focus (e.g., scholar’s view when author’s is asked).
  3. **Option Logic Traps**:
     - Correct interpretation derailed by tricky, close-but-wrong options.
- **Effective Review**:
  - *Compare Pre-Answer to Correct Answer*:
    - **Large Gap**: Issue lies in question or passage comprehension.
      - Check: Misread question focus? Misinterpreted text?
    - **Small Gap**: Issue is option selection.
      - Check: Why was the wrong option appealing? Where’s its flaw?
  - *Future-Oriented*:
    - Focus on transferable lessons (e.g., "Next time, verify the question’s subject").
    - Avoid fixating on the current story—it won’t repeat.
- **Ineffective Review Examples**:
  - Checking answers for satisfaction without analysis.
  - Marking options right/wrong or copying passage text without diagnosing reasoning errors.
