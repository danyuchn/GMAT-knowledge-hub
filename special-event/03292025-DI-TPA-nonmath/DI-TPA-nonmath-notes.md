# GMAT Data Insight: Mastering 2-Part Analysis (TPA)

This guide distills key strategies for tackling the **Data Insight (DI)** section of the GMAT, with a deep dive into the **2-Part Analysis (TPA)** question type. Based on my March 29, 2025 seminar, here’s a structured breakdown to help you decode and conquer this beast.

## Overview

### What is DI?
- **Applied Problems**: 100% real-world case-based, not abstract logic (e.g., "Monday package delivery") or pure math.
- **Text-Heavy**: Expect verbose prompts with low signal-to-noise ratio (10-20% critical info).
- **New Workflow**: Combines charts and text, ditches the classic 5-option MCQ format. Builds on Quant + Verbal (RC/CR) skills but demands a fresh approach.

### What is TPA?
- **Dual-Column Setup**: Two questions (left + right columns) sharing options. One prompt, two answers.
- **Types**:
  - **Math-Related**: Numeric options, data-driven prompts.
  - **Logic-Related**: Text-heavy, minimal numbers, inference-focused.
- **Time**: DI averages 2:15 min/question (45 min / 20 questions). TPA needs 2.5-3 min; offset by faster Data Sufficiency (DST) solves (1.5-2 min).

## Core Strategies

### 1. Role Immersion (The "Substitution Hack")
- **What**: Step into the shoes of a scenario character (e.g., customer, researcher, marketer).
- **Why**: Boosts intuition. Only ~10% of test-takers master this, but they dominate the top 90% of scores.
- **How**: Start with the question, pick a role, then read the prompt. Example: For a bank data-sharing question, think, "Am I okay with my balance being leaked?"

### 2. Question-First + Option Peek
- **Logic TPA**:
  - Read question → Peek 1-2 options → Process prompt.
  - Example: Research conclusion question → Peek options → Spot education theme.
- **Math TPA**:
  - Prompt → Question → Calculate → Pick option.
  - Reason: Numeric options (e.g., "42") mean nothing without context.
- **Why**: Questions filter noise. A bank question about "account balance" skips irrelevant phone number details.

### 3. Five-Line Grid (Your Scratchpad MVP)
- **Setup**: Draw 5 horizontal lines, creating 6 slots.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Math: Compute conditions (e.g., DST’s Condition 1 vs. 2) per slot.
  - Logic: Track options (e.g., "A: Keep, B: Cut").
- **Why**: Beats finger-pointing chaos for TPA’s 25 combos (5×5 options).

### 4. Noise Filtering
- **Rule**: Question defines relevance.
- **Example**: Bank question → "Account balance" focus → Ditch phone numbers and passwords (80%+ of text irrelevant).
- **Tactic**: Highlight question keywords (e.g., "balance"), ignore fluff.

### 5. Split vs. Joint Solving + Elimination
- **Split Solving (Default)**:
  - When: Columns are independent.
  - How: Lock one column, solve the other. Prioritize based on constraints or causality (e.g., cause → effect).
  - Example: Bank sharing (affiliated vs. non-affiliated) → Solve either first.
- **Joint Solving (Rare)**:
  - When: Columns form one sentence (e.g., fill-in-the-blank).
  - Example: Social media strategy → Feature (frequent updates) + Advantage (targeted reach) solved together.
- **Elimination**: Cross off mismatches. Example: Duty ranking → Compare and cut mid-tier options.

## Workflow Examples

### Math TPA
- **Steps**: Prompt → Question → Calc → Options.
- **Scenario**: Sales data prompt → Extract variables → Compute per question → Match numbers.

### Logic TPA
- **Steps**: Question → Peek 1-2 options → Prompt → Map to CR/RC.
- **Mapping**: 
  - CR: Weaken/Strengthen (e.g., research conclusion).
  - RC: Main idea/Inference (e.g., policy intent).
- **Example**: Bank sharing → Question ("conditions") → Prompt → CR-style inference.

### Fill-in-the-Blank Edge Case
- **Approach**: Solve as one unit.
- **Example**: Social media → Role-play as marketer → Link feature (updates) to advantage (targeting).

### Abstract Prompts
- **Tactic**: Break down jargon, rephrase simply.
- **Example**: "Unintended consequences" → "Backfires" → Split roles (agency vs. employee).

## Practical Tips

- **Time Drill**: Simulate 3-min TPA solves with a 5-line grid.
- **Noise Practice**: Flag question keywords, skip 80% fluff.
- **Type Mastery**: Split math (calc-heavy) and logic (text-heavy) drills.

 TPA isn’t just a question—it’s a filter-and-decide game. Nail the question, own the role, and streamline your process.
