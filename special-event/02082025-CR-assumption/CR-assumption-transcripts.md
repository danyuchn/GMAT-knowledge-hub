# GMAN Workshop Summary: Mastering CR Assumption Questions

## Characteristics and Challenges of Assumption Questions
- **Logical Leap**: An unstated connection exists between premises and conclusions, requiring deduction.
- **Unfamiliar in Daily Life**: Assumption logic (preconditions) is uncommon, making it hard to grasp intuitively.
- **Key to Solving**: Identify the "new concept" between premises and conclusions and bridge it.

## Definition of Assumptions
- **Assumption**: An unstated link between premises and conclusions that must hold true for the argument to stand.
  - **Necessary Assumption**: Without it, the argument collapses; with it, the argument may not necessarily hold.
  - **Sufficient Assumption**: With it, the argument must hold; without it, the argument fails.
- **Distinction from Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is an unverified conjecture, while an assumption is a hidden prerequisite for the argument.

## Three-Step Solving Process
1. **Identify the New Concept in the Conclusion**:
   - Look for information in the conclusion not mentioned in the premises.
   - If the conclusion is incomplete, refer to the context to clarify it.
   - Example: Conclusion "consumption rises," premise "study says no risk," new concept is "affects purchasing."
2. **Find the Logical Gap**:
   - Question the link with "Who says X must mean Y?"
   - Example: "Who says preventing leaks ensures no pollution?"
3. **Screen and Validate Options**:
   - **First Round**: Eliminate options that don’t address the gap.
   - **Second Round**: Check attitude (supports argument), scope, and negation test.
     - **Attitude**: Options must uphold the argument, not weaken it.
     - **Scope**: Focus on the question’s subjects (people, time, place).
     - **Negation Test**: If negating an option collapses the argument, it’s a key assumption.

## Advanced Techniques
- **Role Substitution**:
  - To find the gap, adopt the opponent’s perspective to spot flaws.
  - To validate, adopt the proponent’s perspective to confirm the argument holds.
- **Priority Order**:
  - Check scope first if option subjects differ.
  - Attitude next, negation last.
- **Practical Advice**: Use negation in practice to sharpen logic; in exams, pick the answer directly to save time.
