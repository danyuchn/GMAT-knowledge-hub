# GMAT Archaeology Questions Seminar Recap

## Overview
- **Context**: Seminar held on April 19, 2025, focusing on GMAT Verbal Critical Reasoning (CR) archaeology questions, presented by "GMAT Terminator."
- **Challenges of Archaeology Questions**:
  - Unfamiliar to daily life, making intuitive reasoning difficult.
  - Lack clear causal relationships, relying on correlations.
  - Include specialized terminology, increasing reading complexity.
- **Five Thinking Directions**:
  1. **Source Validity**: Evaluate the credibility, representativeness, and sufficiency of evidence sources.
  2. **Temporal Alignment**: Ensure evidence aligns with the conclusion's timeframe.
  3. **Geographical Uniqueness**: Confirm evidence uniquely ties to a specific location.
  4. **Alternative Explanations**: Consider if evidence can be explained by other causes.
  5. **Observational Absence**: Absence of expected evidence may negate an event's occurrence.
- **Key Takeaways**: Read questions carefully, noting tenses and logical connectors, using relatable examples to apply these directions.

## Problem-Solving Strategies (General, Sorted by Similarity)
- **Focusing on Conclusion and Question**:
  - Break down the question and conclusion to identify new concepts (e.g., events, times, locations).
  - Read conclusions precisely, noting keywords and logical structure to avoid conflating evidence impact with outcomes.
  - Ensure evidence logically connects to the conclusion, verifying options address the question directly.
  - High-score strategy: Focus on question cues (e.g., new concepts or logical ties) and filter out background details.

- **Temporal Consistency**:
  - Check if evidence aligns with the conclusion's timeframe, ensuring options support the temporal context.
  - Note tense differences (present vs. past) and eliminate options misaligned with the conclusion's timeframe.
  - Prioritize objective evidence (e.g., data) over subjective accounts, favoring temporally consistent direct evidence.

- **Weakening and Alternative Explanations**:
  - For weakening questions, seek alternative explanations or counterexamples that challenge causality or broad claims.
  - A single counterexample can weaken a broad conclusion; distinguish temporal sequences from causal links.
  - Eliminate options that strengthen the conclusion, ensuring weakening logic is valid.

- **Observational Absence**:
  - Apply observational absence: If a conclusion implies specific evidence, its absence supports or negates the conclusion.
  - Check if options provide evidence of absence to strengthen or weaken the conclusion.

- **Option Filtering and Logical Rigor**:
  - Verify if options directly support or weaken the conclusion's logic, discarding irrelevant or indirect ones.
  - Use the five thinking directions (especially source validity and alternative explanations) to ensure rigorous answers.
  - High-score strategy: Focus on the question and conclusion's logical structure, ignoring redundant background details.
