# A Practical Guide to GMAT Multi-Source Reasoning (MSR)

This document summarizes a lecture by instructor Dustin on practical strategies for the **Multi-Source Reasoning (MSR)** questions in the GMAT Data Insight (DI) section. The lecture emphasizes that the goal is not to solve many problems but to master a core methodology.

The session focuses on three key areas:
1.  **Efficient Information Absorption:** How to quickly process MSR's multi-tab information under pressure.
2.  **Practical Solving Techniques:** How to avoid irrelevant data and use time-saving strategies.
3.  **AI-Powered Review:** How to use AI tools (like GPT, Gemini) for deep, effective post-test analysis to improve your thinking patterns.

### The Challenges of MSR

The instructor highlights several key difficulties with MSR questions:

* **Time Pressure:** The overall DI section is time-crunched (45 minutes for 20 questions), leaving very little time for MSR.
* **Information Complexity:** The question sets involve multiple tabs mixing text, charts, and tables, creating a large and fragmented information landscape.
* **Question Variety:** Problems can test inference, detail-retrieval, and even mathematical calculations.
* **Increased Importance:** The instructor has observed that since March 2025, the number of MSR sets in the official exam has increased from one to two.

**Warning Signs:** You should focus on improving your MSR skills if you consistently:
* Get **fewer than two questions correct** in a 3-question set.
* Take **more than 7 minutes** to complete a set.

### A Practical Strategy for Solving MSR

A non-traditional workflow is proposed, especially beneficial for non-native English speakers.

#### 1. Choose Your Entry Point (Avoid Long Text First)

* **Preferred Method:** Start with the tab containing the **least text and the most visuals** (charts/tables).
    * First, examine the chart's title, axes, and column headers to get a general idea.
    * Then, read the accompanying text descriptions. This order makes the text easier to comprehend.
    * **Note:** At this stage, do **not** pre-process data or make detailed inferences.
* **Alternative Method:** If the visuals themselves are overly complex (e.g., flowcharts), **read the prompt of the first question**. Approaching the tabs with a specific question in mind helps you focus on relevant information.

#### 2. Adopt a Role & Reread the Question

* **Adopt a Role Early:** Immediately place yourself in a specific role (e.g., a gamer, a farmer). This helps in naturally integrating fragmented pieces of information.
* **Read the Question Twice:** This is critical.
    * **First Reading (Pre-Analysis):** To understand the scenario and identify which types of information to look for.
    * **Second Reading (Before Solving):** **This is crucial.** Slow down and read every detail carefully. **Question prompts can sometimes override or modify the default information provided in the source tabs.**

#### 3. Use "Positive Selection" to Choose an Answer

* A key feature of MSR is that much of the information (often 70-80%) is irrelevant to the questions asked.
* Unlike GMAT Reading Comprehension, a slow process of elimination is inefficient here. Due to time constraints, if you find an option that is logically sound and directly supported by the data, you should **select it immediately** and move on without double-checking every other option.
* If an option requires more than two steps of complex calculation, consider skipping it temporarily to check for simpler, more direct options first.

### How to Leverage AI for an Effective Review

The instructor posits that AI is now better at solving individual problems than most human tutors. The value for test-takers is in learning a **transferable thinking process**.

Hereâ€™s how to use AI (especially models with visual reasoning like GPT-4o) for your review:

* **Goal:** Go beyond asking "How to solve this?" and focus on improving your thought process.
* **Input:** Provide the AI with all the MSR tabs (copy-paste text, screenshot visuals) and one question at a time.
* **Use Specific Prompts:**

    1.  **For Basic Understanding:** When you don't understand the solution at all.
        > "Explain the solution to this problem step-by-step, in a way a high school student can understand."

    2.  **To Find Shortcuts:** When your method is too slow.
        > "Provide the fastest, most calculation-light shortcut a human could use to solve this under exam conditions."

    3.  **For Absorption Strategy:** When you struggle with initial reading.
        > "What is the recommended process to quickly absorb the information in these source tabs within 1.5 to 2.5 minutes?"

    4.  **For Methodology Application:** When you want to practice a specific technique.
        > "Apply [insert specific methodology here, e.g., the 'Positive Selection' method] to solve this problem and demonstrate the thought process."

**Core Concept:** The focus of using AI should be on understanding its **logical reasoning chain**, not just the final answer's correctness. If the AI makes a mistake, correct it. This forces it to re-evaluate its logic, providing you with a clearer, more robust thinking model to learn from.
