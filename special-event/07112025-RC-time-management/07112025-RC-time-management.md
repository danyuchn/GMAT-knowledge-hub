# GMAT RC High-Efficiency Strategy: Technical Documentation

This document provides a framework for tackling the GMAT Reading Comprehension (RC) section. The core objective is to efficiently complete an RC passage and its associated questions within the recommended **6 to 8-minute** timeframe, balancing both speed and accuracy.

## 1.0 Core Issues & Mindset

Before diving into strategy, it's crucial to identify and address common bottlenecks and mental blocks.

### 1.1 Common Pitfalls

Many test-takers face the following challenges in the RC section:
* **Exceeding Time Limits**: Spending more than ten minutes on a single passage. 
* **Missing the Big Picture**: Focusing too heavily on understanding individual words and sentences, thereby losing sight of the passage's overall structure and main point. 
* **Ineffective Skimming**: Reading quickly without effective comprehension, which leads to a blank mind when trying to answer questions. 

These issues often result in poor performance under pressure and can negatively impact other sections of the exam. 

### 1.2 Debunking Myths

The goal of GMAT RC is not to make you an expert in the topic presented. You are not expected to understand **100%** of the passage's content. The test is designed to evaluate your ability to quickly **grasp a passage's structure, identify key information, and make logical inferences** under time constraints. 

### 1.3 Mindset Shift

You must transition from being a passive information receiver to an **active, strategic reader**. This involves learning to assess the importance of different parts of the text and actively deciding where to read quickly and where to slow down.

## 2.0 Strategic Reading: Hot & Cold Zones

This is the core reading strategy of the framework, advocating for a dynamic reading speed based on the importance of the information.

### 2.1 `Hot Zone`

Hot Zones contain the passage's critical information and require you to **slow down for careful, in-depth reading**. They typically include three types of information:

* **Topic**: The central subject or issue of the passage, usually identifiable in the opening paragraph.
* **Argument**: An independent claim made by the author or a party within the text to address the topic.
* **Evaluation**: A critique or assessment (e.g., agreement or disagreement) of a previously stated argument.

### 2.2 `Cold Zone`

Cold Zones consist of supplementary details that support or explain the Hot Zones, such as examples, data, or background information. For this type of content, you should **scan quickly**, aiming to understand its function within the passage. If you don't fully understand a detail, do not linger or reread.

## 3.0 Time Management & Solving Process

Precise time allocation and a standardized process are critical for success.

### 3.1 Passage Reading Allocation

* **Standard Time**: For an average-length passage (approx. 250-350 words), your reading time should be contained within **1.5 to 2.5 minutes**.
* **Hard Stop**: Your absolute cut-off time for reading a passage is **3 minutes**. Exceeding this limit requires you to move on to the questions to avoid sinking too much time.

### 3.2 Three-Phase Pacing Strategy

The GMAT's adaptive algorithm means questions at different stages have varying impacts on your score. Your pacing should reflect this.

1.  **First Third (Initial ~8 Questions)**: Questions in this phase have a high impact on your score. **Slightly extend your time** here (e.g., 7 minutes for a 3-question set, 9 minutes for a 4-question set) to maximize accuracy.
2.  **Middle Third**: Revert to the standard **6 to 8-minute** pacing per passage set.
3.  **Final Third**: Questions here have less impact on your score. If you encounter a passage you are not confident about, it is strategically sound to **make an educated guess and move on**, saving that time for reviewing flagged questions from earlier.

### 3.3 Standardized Solving Process

For all question types except for the main idea, strictly adhere to the following three-step process:

1.  **`Locate`**
    * Do not rely on memory alone. Always return to the passage to find the specific text that addresses the question's keywords.

2.  **`Pre-think`**
    * Before looking at the answer choices, use the text you located to **formulate your own answer** in your mind. This crucial step helps you avoid being swayed by cleverly worded distractors.

3.  **`Select`**
    * Compare your pre-thought answer against the five choices. Quickly select the one that aligns best with your formulation.
